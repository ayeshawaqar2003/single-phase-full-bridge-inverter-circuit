# single-phase-full-bridge-inverter-circuit
a single phase full bridge inverter circuit and use Arduino to generate switching pulses/ signals. Observe the output waveform, measure its RMS, frequency and harmonic component.Now use any PWM technique to make RMS variables. Also observe the effect of PWM on the harmonic content of the waveform. Verify the results using any simulation software
